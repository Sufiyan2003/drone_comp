# drone_comp
machine learning for our drone competition


# stuff that is done
the basic exoskeleton on how the machine learning will take place the structure of the directory is defined 

# stuff that needs to be done
make directories for data which contains the corresponding images and labels for train
later we need to add validation and testing dataset to check our trained model
can train our own neural network to optimize results (need to learn how to do this)
need to contain the code for how to apply more precise landing when the drone sees the cross
